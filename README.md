# Cartesian-regulator-for-the-unicycle
The aim of this project is to Implement via software the Cartesian regulator to bring the unicycle from the point
 $q_i$= [5 2 $\pi \over 2$ $]^T$, to the origin.
 
 In the pdf: "Cartesian regulation for the unicycle.pdf" the analysis made is explained in detail.
